title: Morton's neuroma treatments
summary: A comprehensive list of conservative treatments.
---

I'd like to avoid surgery for my Morton's neuroma (as well as other permanent options like alcohol injections), so I'm trying all of these first. I've spent a ton of time trawling the internet for all of this, so here's the comprehensive list. Hopefully it can help someone else.

### Mechanical

**Footwear**
These changes take pressure off metatarsals and encourage them to spread.
* Correct Toes
* Metatarsal pads
* Traditional orthotics (these can be a crutch, not a solution on their own)
* Low heel! Even running shoes often have a high heel-to-toe drop
* Toe socks (Injinji)
* Wide/high toe boxes (a tip - take out the insole, stand on it in bare feet, see if you hang over the edge)
* Thinner/looser socks
* Skip bottom eyelets when lacing shoes
* Well-fitted shoes (if they are too big, you slide around and that puts more pressure on it)
* Adapt existing shoes: use a shoe stretcher; trim above tongue or beside toes to allow toes to spread; use thinner inserts

**Functional correction**
* Physical therapy (stretching, massage, toe strength, ankle strength, [some examples](https://www.sportsrec.com/424817-types-of-physical-therapy-for-mortons-neuroma.html))
* Foot self-massage
* Stretching calves (and maybe ankles) - this one seems very important.
* [Metatarsal mobilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr8KnlMDez0)
* Foot/glute strength
* Exercises: [set 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MgZYsIqrw), [set 2](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17878300-exercises-for-foot-pain) [set 3](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17915320-top-exercises-for-feet-toes)

### Calming the nerve and surrounding tissues

**Reducing inflammation/pain**
* Ice, ice massage
* Cortisone shots (they're not great for other tissues though)
* Anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs, herbal)
* Ultrasound?
* Rest (but not too much)
* Prescription meds for nerve pain

**Reducing pressure on the nerve**
* Cushioned shoes
* Change up shoes frequently to put pressure on different areas
* Yoga Toes (improve mobility)
* Toe spacer socks while sleeping

### Promoting bloodflow/healing

* Contrast therapy
* Taping with kinesio tape (more on that below)
* [Topicals like menthol or capsaicin](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17882504-foot-circulation-tips)
* Massage of surrounding areas
* Laser therapy (MLS)?

### Living with the pain

* Find another form of exercise
* "Lean into" other hobbies
* Keep up activity as much as possible - drive, bike, use a cane, go slow
* Meditation, therapy

### Ideas random people have mentioned

* Muscle relaxer cream
* CBD cream
* Oral THCA for nerve pain
* Acupuncture
* Prolotherapy
* Chiropractors (breaking up scar tissue)
* Could be misdiagnosed as tarsal tunnel syndrome? 
* Nerve pain: neuro-eze/neuro-one topicals, lidoderm patches
* Ball of foot [wrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=381&v=6vS8s2zLOSU&feature=emb_logo)
* Nerve flossing (instructions [here](https://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=56083>) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g94F8g_jzGg))
* Treat issues with lower back? L5 nerve; core strengthening
* [This massage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6ROKuM3rjs&t=8s) which seems easy to do wrong
* Other injections: capsaicin, stem cells, B vitamins, platelet rich plasma
* Trim hole in insole under neuroma

### About taping

Taping strategies:
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdEv7ayilec>
    * piece 1: cut four strips most of the way down
    * anchor behind heel 
    * flex toes, put strips between and above toes with some stretch, anchor midfoot
    * piece 2: short piece of tape to cover ends of strips
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9qgYPrku4>
    * piece 1: cut piece that fits all the way around ball of foot
    * anchor near big toe, stretch ~50-70% under foot and anchor on outer side of foot
    * stretch over foot (50-70%) and anchor by big toe
    * piece 2: fits over foot horizontally just behind first piece, stretch 70% and put over foot, then anchor sides
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgQF4D792g>
    * piece 1: 10 inch piece with two diamond holes in the middle, fit over problematic toes, 10% tension for the middle third of tape
    * anchor at ends
    * piece 2: go around under base of foot with 10% tension, anchor top midfoot
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_BTmrYSxg8>
    * piece 1: cut three strips most of the way down
    * anchor top midfoot, put strips between toes with some tension about an inch on either side
    * anchor the rest on bottom of foot
    * piece 2: strip under foot on ball, 100% tension , anchor at sides of foot
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLA11cJSp8A&t=11s>
    * piece 1: cut strip to go mostly around ball of foot
    * stretch about 100% under ball of foot
    * anchor at sides and top

What's in common between these strategies?
* piece under ball of foot, between 10-100% stretch
* piece that goes between toes

Why does taping work? (from comments on <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9qgYPrku4>)
>> If you wrapped the tape completely around with consistent stretch all the way thru then yes, it would compress the tissue. That's why I incorporated anchor points on both ends with zero stretch, so the tape behaves as a cross fiber taping for increased circulation, which will create surface area by lifting the skin towards least resistance. away from the body.

### Resources

There are a million articles that say roughly the same thing - metatarsal pads, orthotics, cortisone shots, surgery. Here are some more thorough and alternative views. They may or may not be reliable.

Some simple conservative treatments; more thorough than other sites
* <https://bootbomb.com/mortons-neuroma-conservative-treatments/>
* <https://www.mortonsneuroma.com/mortons-neuroma/treatments/conservative-options/>

I like [this article](http://foodsforlonglife.blogspot.com/2016/04/traditional-and-alternative-methods-of.html) - thorough review of someone's experience

[This guy](http://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2015/01/mortons-neuroma-general-principles.html) has a lot of ideas and opinions; he says you should always address all three of mechanical, inflammatory, and neurological issues.

A lot of alternative views [here](http://teamdoctorsblog.com/2012/12/24/mortons-neuroma-self-help-tips-treatment-and-prevention-from-the-barefoot-running-doctor-at-team-doctors/), with focus on massage/stretching.

### My current strategy
* Strength
  * Ankle: band kicks (20x), alphabet (1x)
  * Foot: towel grab (20x), toe raises (10x)
  * Calf: sitting calf raises (20x)
* Mobility
  * Calf stretching (3x30s, 3x per day)
  * Foot rolling (3x per day)
  * Metatarsal mobilization
  * Nerve glides (10x, 3x per day)
* Inflammation
  * Vitamins/supplements
  * L-arginine cream
  * (Ice and/or KT tape when painful)
* Footwear
  * Metatarsal pads in house shoes
  * Orthotics + Altras outside
* General fitness
  * Yoga
  * Pilates, body weight workouts
  * Daily walking

### My current strategy

strength:
ankle: band kicks (20x), alphabet (1x)
foot: towel grab (20x), toe raises (20x)
calf: sitting calf raises (20x)

mobility:
(heat)
calf rolling, then *calf stretching*
*foot rolling*, then foot stretching (*achilles*, plantar fascia, metatarsal mobilization)
*nerve glides*

*then ice*

YOGA

Strength/flexibility
* Foot self-massage (ball roll)
* Foot strength: towel grab, toe raises
* Calf stretching daily
* PT exercise (one-leg kicks with resistance band, achilles stretch)
* More general exercise: floor strength exercises, floor yoga, water aerobics

Footwear
* Correct Toes
* Metatarsal pads in slippers
* Regular orthotics
* Altras

Inflammation
* Icing
* CBD cream
* Zyflamend

Maybe try
* Kinesio taping
* Nerve glides (10 reps 3x/day) (on back, flex foot, bend knee, point foot and look at it, straighten leg)
* Metatarsal mobilization (pulling apart horizontally and vertically)
* Yoga Toes (though this maybe was correlated to pain before?)
* Acupuncture

### History

* Start (Sep 18): sprained ankle while hiking, had to walk a few miles on it
* 3 weeks: ankle still hurts; get x-rays from doctor and he refers me to a podiatrist (Dr. Hershman)
* 6 weeks: walking more, climbing some, but neuroma starts to flare up
* 7 weeks: go to Dr. Hershman - get cortisone shots which make things way worse, and metatarsal pads which are a bit helpful, but generally it's a terrible experience
* 2 months (Nov 18): start going to PT weekly; start occasional climbing
* 3 months (Dec 18): first run, 0.4 miles; running up to 1 mile by end of the month
* 4 months (Jan 19): go on vacation to Indonesia, walk a lot with minimal pain; return with increased pain so stop running; mistakenly climb in tight shoes, no more climbing after that
* 5 months (Feb 19): things are going badly, so PT refers me to new podiatrist (Dr. Chou)
* 6 months (Mar 19): see Dr. Chou, get OTC powerstep orthotics, and she said to come back in 4 months if they're not working
* 7 months (Apr 19): start running again, also move apartments
* 8 months (May 19): ill-advised walk/run 5k; no more running after that
* 9 months (Jun 19): PT gives up on me, says to work through issues with podiatrist first
* 10 months (Jul 19): go to Europe, successfully walk a lot with a cane; book a followup with Dr. Chou
* 11 months (Aug 19): go to Dr. Chou, get fit for custom orthotics (set #1) and start a month of MLS laser therapy
* 12 months (Sep 19): start using orthotics #1
* 13 months (Oct 19): orthotics not working as well as they should, but are a bit uneven so get fit for set #2; manage to do 3 mi hike!
* 14 months (Nov 19): get new orthotics #2, still uneven so end up wearing one new and one old; also manage to walk 17k steps in one day
* 15 months (Dec 19): orthotics still not perfect, fit for new set #3; go on vacation and do too much beach walking
* 16 months (Jan 20): increased pain after vacation; started newest orthotics #3
* 17 months (Feb 20): orthotics fit correctly; Dr. Chou says it may take up to 6 months for full recovery (end of July); second opinion appointment with Dr. Co confirms treatment; start PT again; got Altras that fit orthotics
* 18 months (Mar 20): followup with Dr. Chou, got more laser therapy and she suggested injections might be necessary in a month
* (19 months (Apr 20): followup with Dr. Chou, scheduled appointment with Dr. Blake)
