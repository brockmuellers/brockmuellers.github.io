I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco. I have 6+ years of experience in backend development, focused on building cloud-based platforms/frameworks and scaling systems.

I'm currently looking for a new role, specifically at companies working on climate change and sustainability (renewable energy, conservation agriculture, environmental projects, etc). If you work in that space, I'd love to talk!
