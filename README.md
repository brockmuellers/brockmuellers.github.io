# brockmuellers.github.io

My personal site. WIP.

This is built on github pages with jekyll. There's some odd lualatex in here that generates a pdf resume. Wildly unnecessary, but it was fun to write.

Disclaimer: I'm not a front-end dev and this site reflects that fact.

Find me at [brockmuellers.com](https://self.brockmuellers.com).
