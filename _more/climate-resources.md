## Industries with most software jobs

Tons of options:
* Energy use optimization (for both businesses and consumers): smart buildings, smart motors, energy tracking tools
* Renewable energy (mostly solar): installation design, management systems, financing/insurance
* Food: reducing waste, robotic farming, ML for farm operations
* Transportation: electric buses and fleet vehicles, charging infrastructure

Just a few options:
* Grid/microgrid optimization
* Reforestation
* Technology development (these tend to be less software-focused): battery development, engineering cleaner industrial materials, direct air capture
* Female empowerment: microloans, improving birth control availability
