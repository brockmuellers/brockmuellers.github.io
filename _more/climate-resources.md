title: Climate change resources
summary:  >-
    A set of resources I've collected on 
    understanding and combating climate change.

I've spent several months trying to understand climate change and the current state of mitigation strategies. These are some resources that I've found helpful.

## Staying positive

## Finding a job

[A post on finding relevant companies](https://medium.com/@leventov/how-to-find-a-job-in-a-tech-company-helping-to-combat-climate-change-practical-guide-e212e262a32), and an associated open [database of organizations](https://climatescape.org/) fighting climate change

[Step-by-step guide for the job search process](https://voice.ch.ckl.st/how-i-am-fighting-climate-change-as-a-software-developer/amp/)

Places to look for jobs:
* **<https://climate.careers/>**
* <https://techjobsforgood.com/>
* <https://www.splashwithdolphin.com/>
* <https://www.cleanenergyjobslist.com/>
* [Startup jobs on AngelList](https://angel.co/jobs); can filter by industry
* Look at the portfolios of VC firms that focus on social impact
    * <https://www.congruentvc.com/>
    * <https://www.fifty.vc/>
    * <http://www.dblpartners.vc/>
    * <https://obvious.com/>

Industries with most software jobs:
* Tons of options:
    * Energy use optimization (for both businesses and consumers): smart buildings, smart motors, energy tracking tools
    * Renewable energy (mostly solar): installation design, management systems, financing/insurance
    * Food: reducing waste, robotic farming, ML for farm operations
    * Transportation: electric buses and fleet vehicles, charging infrastructure
* Just a few options:
    * Grid/microgrid optimization
    * Reforestation
    * Technology development (these tend to be less software-focused): battery development, engineering cleaner industrial materials, direct air capture
    * Female empowerment: microloans, improving birth control availability

While [this article on facing extinction](https://www.catherineingram.com/facingextinction/) is immensely depressing and I don't entirely agree with its assumptions, I like this quote about blame and anger related to climate change:
>> In a recent blog post, writer James Kunstler proposed a pithy theory of why humans chose each step of our path in history: “It just seemed a good idea at the time.”  We plunged forward with each new way of doing things, each new invention, because it made life easier at the time.  There was no intention to destroy ourselves.\
...\
As theoretical physicist Peter Russell mused in a podcast conversation with me in 2016, “What if we saw ourselves as a cosmic flame blooming in the universe and coming to its natural end?”\
What if we forgave everybody everything?
