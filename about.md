Just a bit about me.

### Professional

Professionally, I'm a software engineer. I'm most interested in backend work and building tools for developers. So far, my favorite technical project has been designing a distributed data processing system for scientists developing image analysis algorithms. Recently I've been enjoying designing frameworks and libraries. It's surprising how much fun creating a good test library can be.

I want to spend my day job working on important problems with serious social [impact](https://impactmanagementproject.com/impact-management/what-is-impact/). The greatest problem facing the world today, IMO, is climate change. I intend to transition to doing software work at a company making meaningful progress on that front.

One of the most important things I look for in a job is the team. The best kind of team is collaborative, supportive, curious about a wide variety of things, and passionate (in both professional work and personal projects).

(Here's my [resume page]({% link resume.md %}), which describes my experience in more detail.)

### Personal

I grew up on a farm in South Dakota, with a few years in rural Cambodia. Then I went to MIT in Boston, and am now based in San Francisco. This has given me a diverse perspective on the world, as well as a love for raising goats, catching frogs in rice paddies, banging my head against the wall while solving hard problems, mountains, and costume parties.

I love hiking in the mountains or finding dark skies to look at the stars - there's nothing better to remind me that my problems are tiny and the universe is vast and beautiful. My apartment has been described as a jungle: ~40 species of mostly-tropical plants, two geckos, and the occasional tropical cockroach. I spend a lot of time hanging out with my cat, since she's the best cat. Occasionally I'll have a flash of inspiration and dive into a project that I know nothing about (recently, thermoplastics for cosplay). My favorite kind of project is one that leads me into brand new territory.

Currently, I'm taking some time off to read, write, create, and figure out what I want to work on next.
