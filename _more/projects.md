### Toothless

Toothless (dragon) costume, from the movie "How to Train Your Dragon". Sadly I don't have a picture of the finished product or the adorable dragon face. Made from stretchy vinyl, with articulated wings, stuffed spines, and a hood. Designed to be pinned to an existing outfit. October 2017.

### Crested gecko enclosure

Cage for my crested gecko. 36" x 30" x 28". Made from acrylic plexiglass, hardware cloth, magnets, and a lot of wire. Very janky, but it worked quite well for 3+ years (until the rust set in). September 2015.
