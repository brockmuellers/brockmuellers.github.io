title: Morton's neuroma treatments
summary: A comprehensive list of conservative treatments.
---

I'd like to avoid surgery for my Morton's neuroma (as well as other permanent options like alcohol injections), so I'm trying all of these first. I've spent a ton of time trawling the internet for all of this, so here's the comprehensive list. Hopefully it can help someone else.

### Mechanical

**Footwear**\
These changes take pressure off metatarsals and encourage them to spread.
* Correct Toes
* Toe socks (Injinji)
* Wide/high toe boxes (a tip - take out the insole, stand on it in bare feet, see if you hang over the edge)
* Adapting shoes that are too tight: use a shoe stretcher; trim above tongue or beside toes to allow toes to spread; use thinner inserts
* Thinner/looser socks
* Skip bottom eyelets when lacing shoes
* Metatarsal pads
* Traditional orthotics (these can be a crutch, not a solution on their own)
* Low heel! Even running shoes often have a high heel-to-toe drop.
* Well-fitted shoes (if they are too big, you slide around and that puts more pressure on it)

**Functional correction**
* Physical therapy (stretching, massage, toe strength, ankle strength, [some examples](https://www.sportsrec.com/424817-types-of-physical-therapy-for-mortons-neuroma.html))
* Foot self-massage
* Stretching calves (and maybe ankles) - this one seems very important.
* [Metatarsal mobilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr8KnlMDez0)
* Foot/glute strength
* Exercises: [set 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MgZYsIqrw), [set 2](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17878300-exercises-for-foot-pain) [set 3](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17915320-top-exercises-for-feet-toes)

### Calming the nerve and surrounding tissues

**Reducing inflammation/pain**
* Ice
* Cortisone shots (they're not great for other tissues though)
* Anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs, herbal)
* Laser therapy (MLS), ultrasound?
* Rest (but not too much)
* Ice massage
* Prescription meds for nerve pain

**Reducing pressure on the nerve**
* Cushioned shoes
* Change up shoes frequently to put pressure on different areas
* Yoga Toes (improve mobility)
* Toe spacer socks while sleeping

### Promoting bloodflow/healing

* Contrast therapy
* Taping with kinesio tape (more on that below)
* [Topicals like menthol or capsaicin](https://naturalfootgear.com/blogs/education/17882504-foot-circulation-tips)
* Massage of surrounding areas

### Living with the pain

* Find another form of exercise
* "Lean into" other hobbies
* Keep up activity as much as possible - drive, bike, use a cane, go slow
* Meditation, therapy

### Stuff random people mentioned

* Muscle relaxer cream
* CBD cream
* Oral THCA for nerve pain
* Acupuncture
* Chiropractors (breaking up scar tissue)
* Could be misdiagnosed as tarsal tunnel syndrome? 
* Nerve pain: neuro-eze/neuro-one topicals, lidoderm patches
* Ball of foot [wrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=381&v=6vS8s2zLOSU&feature=emb_logo)
* Nerve flossing (instructions [here](https://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=56083>) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g94F8g_jzGg))
* Treat issues with lower back? L5 nerve; core strengthening
* [This massage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6ROKuM3rjs&t=8s) which seems easy to do wrong
* Other injections: capsaicin, stem cells, B vitamins, platelet rich plasma
* Trim hole in insole under neuroma

### About taping

Taping strategies:
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdEv7ayilec>
    * piece 1: cut four strips most of the way down
    * anchor behind heel 
    * flex toes, put strips between and above toes with some stretch, anchor midfoot
    * piece 2: short piece of tape to cover ends of strips
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db9qgYPrku4>
    * piece 1: cut piece that fits all the way around ball of foot
    * anchor near big toe, stretch ~50-70% under foot and anchor on outer side of foot
    * stretch over foot (50-70%) and anchor by big toe
    * piece 2: fits over foot horizontally just behind first piece, stretch 70% and put over foot, then anchor sides
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgQF4D792g>
    * piece 1: 10 inch piece with two diamond holes in the middle, fit over problematic toes, 10% tension for the middle third of tape
    * anchor at ends
    * piece 2: go around under base of foot with 10% tension, anchor top midfoot
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_BTmrYSxg8>
    * piece 1: cut three strips most of the way down
    * anchor top midfoot, put strips between toes with some tension about an inch on either side
    * anchor the rest on bottom of foot
    * piece 2: strip under foot on ball, 100% tension , anchor at sides of foot
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLA11cJSp8A&t=11s>
    * piece 1: cut strip to go mostly around ball of foot
    * stretch about 100% under ball of foot
    * anchor at sides and top
    * tried this; worked great for right foot, okay for left

What's in common between these strategies?
* piece under ball of foot, between 10-100% stretch
* piece that goes between toes
* one guy put a second piece just behind the ball piece, only over top of the foot

Why does taping work?

Thanks for the question. I know where you are going with that logic, however that's not happening with this kinesiology taping because of the details. If you wrapped the tape completely around with consistent stretch all the way thru then yes, it would compress the tissue. That's why I incorporated anchor points on both ends with zero stretch, so the tape behaves as a cross fiber taping for increased circulation, which will create surface area by lifting the skin towards least resistance. away from the body. It counter intuitive at first, but that's how the tape behaves and you can see it in other well established and accepted taping styles. Please check out my 101 video on kinesio taping, it may provide some clarity and insight. I've used this taping myself many times in the past and it worked for me. I have no issues with my foot now. I just wanted to share it with others. I hope it helps!

### Resources

There are a million articles that say roughly the same thing - metatarsal pads, orthotics, cortisone shots, surgery. Here are some more thorough and alternative views. They may or may not be reliable.

Some simple conservative treatments; more thorough than other sites

I like [this article](http://foodsforlonglife.blogspot.com/2016/04/traditional-and-alternative-methods-of.html) - thorough review of someone's experience

[This guy](http://www.drblakeshealingsole.com/2015/01/mortons-neuroma-general-principles.html) has a lot of ideas and opinions; he says you should always address all three of mechanical, inflammatory, and neurological issues.

A lot of alternative views [here](http://teamdoctorsblog.com/2012/12/24/mortons-neuroma-self-help-tips-treatment-and-prevention-from-the-barefoot-running-doctor-at-team-doctors/), with focus on massage/stretching.

# My experience

### My current strategy

Strength/flexibility
* Foot self-massage (ball roll)
* Foot strength: towel grab, toe raises
* Calf stretching daily
* PT exercise (one-leg kicks with resistance band, achilles stretch)
* More general exercise: floor strength exercises, floor yoga, water aerobics

Footwear
* Correct Toes
* Metatarsal pads in slippers
* Regular orthotics
* Altras

Inflammation
* Icing
* CBD cream
* Zyflamend

Maybe try
* Kinesio taping
* Nerve glides (10 reps 3x/day) (on back, flex foot, bend knee, point foot and look at it, straighten leg)
* Metatarsal mobilization (pulling apart horizontally and vertically)
* Yoga Toes (though this maybe was correlated to pain before?)
* Acupuncture

### Step goals

Increase by ~10% every week. 

16 week step goal program: (weekly / daily)

### History

* Start (Sep 18): sprained ankle while hiking, had to walk a few miles on it
* 3 weeks: ankle still hurts; get x-rays from doctor and he refers me to a podiatrist (Dr. Hershman)
* 6 weeks: walking more, climbing some, but neuroma starts to flare up
* 7 weeks: go to Dr. Hershman - get cortisone shots which make things way worse, and metatarsal pads which are a bit helpful, but generally it's a terrible experience
* 2 months (Nov 18): start going to PT weekly; start occasional climbing
* 3 months (Dec 18): first run, 0.4 miles; running up to 1 mile by end of the month
* 4 months (Jan 19): go on vacation to Indonesia, walk a lot with minimal pain; return with increased pain so stop running; mistakenly climb in tight shoes, no more climbing after that
* 5 months (Feb 19): things are going badly, so PT refers me to new podiatrist (Dr. Chou)
* 6 months (Mar 19): see Dr. Chou, get OTC powerstep orthotics, and she said to come back in 4 months if they're not working
* 7 months (Apr 19): start running again, also move apartments
* 8 months (May 19): ill-advised walk/run 5k; no more running after that
* 9 months (Jun 19): PT gives up on me, says to work through issues with podiatrist first
* 10 months (Jul 19): go to Europe, successfully walk a lot with a cane; book a followup with Dr. Chou
* 11 months (Aug 19): go to Dr. Chou, get fit for custom orthotics (set #1) and start a month of MLS laser therapy
* 12 months (Sep 19): start using orthotics #1
* 13 months (Oct 19): orthotics not working as well as they should, but are a bit uneven so get fit for set #2; manage to do 3 mi hike!
* 14 months (Nov 19): get new orthotics #2, still uneven so end up wearing one new and one old; also manage to walk 17k steps in one day
* 15 months (Dec 19): orthotics still not perfect, fit for new set #3; go on vacation and do too much beach walking
* 16 months (Jan 20): increased pain after vacation; started newest orthotics #3
* 17 months (Feb 20): orthotics fit correctly; Dr. Chou says it may take up to 6 months for full recovery (end of July); second opinion appointment with Dr. Co confirms treatment; start PT again
* (18 months (Mar 20): will have followup with Dr. Chou)
* (19 months (Apr 20): scheduled appointment with Dr. Blake)
